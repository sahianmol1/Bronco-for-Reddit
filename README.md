# Bronco for Reddit

**Bronco for Reddit** is a free, open-source Reddit client for Android that showcases the use of a **multi-module, clean code MVVM architecture**. It is an offline-first app built using Jetpack Compose and adheres to Material 3 guidelines.

Reddit has an undocumented feature that provides data from their servers as JSON feed. Bronco uses this public JSON feed instead of the official APIs, which makes it suitable only for accessing public data from Reddit's servers.

My motivation for developing this project was to gain hands-on experience with multi-module architecture in Android. Many tutorials and sample apps I found were either too simplistic (lacking real-world complexity) or overly complicated. Bronco for Reddit strikes a balance, making it an ideal project for learning about clean code architecture.

üöß Currently, the app is in its MVP stage, and I plan to add more features in future updates. These updates will further demonstrate the scalability, testability, and flexibility of this architecture. üöß

## Architecture
![Dependency graph](/docs/images/coremodulegraph/high_level_module_graph_2.png)

This is a high level multi module dependency graph. For detailed dependencies checkout [module wise dependency graph](/docs/images/graphs).

### Modularization Strategy

This project follows modularization **by feature & layer** as described in [this video](https://youtu.be/16SwTvzDO0A?si=qHSqHXnW8jSHjitB&t=249). This approach ensures that modules are both highly cohesive and loosely coupled, while also reducing the redundant code.

This architecture leverages the [Dependency Inversion principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_inversion_principle) (DIP). High-level modules (e.g., presentation) should not depend on low-level modules (e.g., data). Instead, both should depend on abstractions (e.g., domain).

**Delegates** are used for [module to module communication](https://developer.android.com/topic/modularization/patterns#communication). Delegates are powerful because they enable class-level runtime polymorphism, promoting the use of [composition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composition_over_inheritance) for code reuse. Checkout [/app/delegates](app/src/main/java/com/anmolsahi/broncoforreddit/delegates).

<sup>*</sup> There are many features. Currently showing only 3 for the sake of simplicity.

## ‚úÖ Unit tests
I have added unit tests for the `:search` module. checkout the unit test here.
<br>üöß Unit test for the other modules are work in progress üöß.

If you find this project valuable or if you like the app, please give it a star ‚≠êÔ∏è! Your support means a lot and motivates me to continue improving the project. üôè
